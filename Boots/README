+ What the fuck is this ?
- This is a Unix/Windows library that provide features necessary for Network communication, by
  providing a C++ interface for RCP-like usage.
  The specificity of this system is that the callbacks can also point to the same process. In
  this case, they can be synchronous or not.

+ Is that all ?
- Well there's also a set of object for regular network handling, such as serializing, select
  and socket abstraction, rolling buffers and such.
  It also incoroporate abstraction for some OSes specific features, namely filesystem operations
  (and there is more to come on this part).

+ Why was it developed ?
  It's basically a tool to ease and fasten the work of a C++ developer.
  Many templates and macro have been developed to help the implementation of popular design
  patterns (singleton, state machine, flyweight...).
  It's goal is to cover with simplicity every bit of everyday C++ developping that is rarely
  made easy in general-purpose developing libraries.

+ Where's the freaking doc ?
  There's no documentation for now. The library is still in development and documentation is
  prompt to change too often for me to bother to write the doc right now.
  There will be in the future.

+ How do I install this fuck ?
- cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make install (you need to be root, or to type sudo make install)

+ Wait what ? I use Windows and I don't get it !
- Use the CMake client for windows and Visual Studio or Mingw.

Hope you enjoy the lib. Cheers.
