=> PolymorphicSignal
- Identifier
PolymorphicSignal need to have an Identifier.
Several PolymorphicSignal can have the same Identifier, as long as they're not linked to the same
SignalRemoteSource.

- Modes
-> Direct
The callbacks are immediately called when the signal is emitted.

-> Queue
The signal emitions are stored and the callbacks are called when the SignalMaster is Refreshed.

-> Network
The signal emitions are stored.
When the SignalMaster is Refreshed, any call emitted from the signal itself are sent to the Network.
The linked callbacks are called right after.

- Remote Sources
SignalRemoteSource may be used to receive calls from the Network.

=> PolymorphicSignalMaster
A PolymorphicSignalMaster is a container for PolymorphicSignals which will allow you to execute
every stored calls from your Signal (and send them to the network if needed).

PolymorphicSignals may not belong to several PolymorphicSignalMaster.

=> SignalRemoteSource
RemoteSources are used to retrieve calls from the Network.
They're listening to a Socket and push to the corresponding PolymorphicSignal any call they receive
that match the PolymorphicSignal Identifier.
